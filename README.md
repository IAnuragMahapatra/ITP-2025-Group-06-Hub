   Open a terminal and run:

   ```

   Then, go to the appropriate week's folder (e.g., `week_1_assignment`):

   cd week_1_assignment
   ```

   Create a folder with your name and add your files:

   ```bash
   mkdir yourname
   cd yourname
   ```

   Save your solution files (e.g., `q1.cpp`, `q2.cpp`, etc.) and include a screenshot showing each file in executione (e.g., `q1.png` or `q1.jpg`).

4. **Stage and Commit Your Changes**  

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add my solution for week-n assignment"
   ```

   Replace `week-n` with the correct week number.

   git fetch upstream
   git checkout main
   git merge upstream/main
   git push origin main
   ```

6. **Pull & Push Your Changes**  
   To make sure your branch is fully up-to-date with your remote fork before pushing your changes, run: 

   ```bash
   git pull origin main
   ```
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```
